# Email-Lists-Checker

Python based program that checks a new email list against an old list to let you know which emails addresses have been added and removed.

How to use the program:
1. Paste old email list in the first text box (ONE EMAIL ADDRESS PER LINE).
2. Paste new email list in the second text box (ONE EMAIL ADDRESS PER LINE).
3. Click Run to see results.

The Save Results button saves two CSV files. One CSV file for added emails and another CSV file for removed emails.
Both files are saved in the working directory of the program.
The Reset button clears all text boxes for easy repeated use of the program.
